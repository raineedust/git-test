# Git Test


This shall be my first GitHub repository. Hello World, and good luck to fellow Odin students! ðŸ‘‹

Since this repo was primarily created for testing purposes, allow me to divert your attention to something useful:

> Git is hard: messing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem.

Does this sound relatable? I highly recommend checking out [Dangit, Git!?!](https://dangitgit.com/en) for common solutions to your occassional Git screw-ups!
