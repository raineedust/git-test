# Git Test


This shall be my first GitHub repository. Hello fellow Odin students! :wave:

Allow me to divert your attention to this:

> Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem.

Does this sound relatable? I highly recommend checking out [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) for common solutions to your daily Git screw-ups!
